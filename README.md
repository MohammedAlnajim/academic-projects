### 1. Implementing and Extending a Multi-Modal Large Language Model for Protein Function
- Fine-tuned a multi-modal large language model (LoRA) for protein function prediction.  
- Evaluated semantic alignment using BLEU, SimCSE, and perplexity metrics.  
- **Focus:** Applied deep learning and transfer learning in bioinformatics.

### 2. Nash Equilibrium in Shared Electric Vehicle Charging Stations
- Modeled electric vehicle charging allocation using game theory and Q-learning.  
- Integrated queuing theory (M/M/c) with Nash equilibrium analysis for resource optimization.  
- **Focus:** Multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning, and optimization.

### 3. Walmart Stores Sales Forecasting Using LSTM Networks
- Designed time-series forecasting models for weekly retail sales.  
- Compared regression baselines against optimized LSTM architectures with advanced regularization.  
- Achieved a validation loss of **0.0022**, demonstrating strong model performance.  
- **Focus:** Deep learning for time-series prediction and applied ML in retail analytics.
